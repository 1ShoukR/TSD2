# Website Overview

Each page identifies and displays different aspects of the Star Wars universe, including the different planets, vehicles used, featured characters, different species, and the many starships used throughout the canon and lore of Star Wars. Users can also add each item from the different pages into their favorites page to view them later.

# Thoughts on The Smuggler's Den
This website is the fourth major project in our Digital Crafts Coding Bootcamp. It is created to identify and demonstrate an understanding of React.js for the frontend framework, and Redux to manage global state data. 

To further develop "The Smuggler's Den', I would: 
- create a backend and allow users to create an account on the webpage
- user login, user specific favorites page, and the ability to make posts within a forums page for users to share their favorite Star Wars items in a public stage
